<h1>The Best Movies According to Mihai</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It suffered at the box office and failed to win any Oscars, but the 1994 prison drama is still seen by many as greater than The Godfather.
</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>A relentlessly chilling mystery and a white-knuckle thriller.</p>
<h3>American Pie</h3>
<p>It is hilarious from start to finish.</p>
